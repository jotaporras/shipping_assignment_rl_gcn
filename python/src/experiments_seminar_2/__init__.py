"""
This module contains the code for running the experiments
for Seminar II (Starting July 2021). They include important refactors
to make code between agents more repeatable.

The motivation for this module was after having to change a lot of
duplicate code when updating libraries (in what was the experiments_v2
 package, if it still exists by the time you read this)

2022-07-02: Just confirming that this is still the module to look to to reproduce the experiments.
Someday, if someone's interested, I might document the details of the experiment architecture.
